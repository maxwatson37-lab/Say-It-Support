            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How does voice verification work?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Say It uses your device's microphone to verify that you're speaking your affirmations aloud. Your voice is processed locally on your device and is never recorded, stored, or transmitted. This ensures your privacy while providing accountability.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Why do I need to speak affirmations?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Speaking affirmations aloud is scientifically proven to be more effective than reading silently. It activates multiple brain pathways, creates emotional connection, and builds stronger neural patterns for positive thinking.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How do I cancel my subscription?</div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What happens if I miss a day?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Free users will lose their streak if they miss a day. Premium members get 2 streak freeze tokens per month, which automatically protect your streak if you miss a day. This gives you flexibility while maintaining accountability.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Can I create my own affirmations?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Yes! Premium members can create unlimited custom affirmations tailored to their specific goals and needs. Free users have access to our curated library of 500+ affirmations across 11 categories.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How many affirmations should I do per day?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">We recommend 5-7 affirmations daily for best results. Free users can complete 2 affirmations per day, while Premium members have unlimited access.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Is my voice data private?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Absolutely. Your voice is processed entirely on your device using on-device speech recognition. We never record, store, or transmit your voice data. The app simply verifies that you spoke - it doesn't analyze what you said or how you said it.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between Free and Premium?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <strong>Free:</strong> 2 affirmations/day, basic streak tracking, ads<br>
                    <strong>Premium ($4.99/month or $39.99/year):</strong> Unlimited affirmations, custom affirmations, 2 streak freezes/month, advanced analytics, ad-free experience, premium audio backgrounds

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How do I restore my purchase on a new device?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Your Premium subscription is tied to your Apple ID. Simply download the app on your new device, sign in with the same Apple ID, and your Premium features will automatically restore.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">The app isn't recognizing my voice. What should I do?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    • Ensure you've granted microphone permissions in Settings<br>
                    • Speak clearly and at normal volume<br>
                    • Reduce background noise<br>
                    • Make sure your device's microphone isn't covered<br>
                    • Try restarting the app<br>

            <h2>💡 Tips for Success</h2>
            <h3>Best Time to Practice</h3>
            <p>Morning (within 30 minutes of waking) is ideal, but evening before bed also works well. Consistency matters more than timing.</p>
            
            <h3>How to Speak Your Affirmations</h3>
            <p>Speak with confidence and emotion. Don't just read - feel the words. Make eye contact with yourself in a mirror for added impact.</p>
            
            <h3>Building Your Streak</h3>
            <p>Start small. Even 1-2 affirmations daily builds the habit. Consistency beats intensity.</p>

Hello,

Thank you for your feedback. I have addressed both issues:

1. Guideline 4.0 (Design): The app is configured as iPhone-only 
   (UIDeviceFamily: [1]). The iPad-specific icon assets that were 
   inadvertently included have been removed. I have uploaded a new 
   build (version 1.0, build 19) that is properly configured for 
   iPhone-only deployment.

2. Guideline 1.5 (Safety): I have created a comprehensive support 
   page at https://[YOUR-URL-HERE] with:
   - Contact email and response times
   - Comprehensive FAQ section
   - Privacy information
   - Subscription cancellation instructions
   - Troubleshooting guides

The support URL has been updated in App Store Connect and is now 
fully functional.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Jonathan Watson
